Data reduction can be done by running several scripts from command line.
Unix shell utility scripts (autorun, autodisplay, autoimage) that uses the main Python script gauss_fitting.py for processing the LCP and RCP data (left and right polarization), creating resulting files and images. The program was developed in 2017-2019 in SHAO CAS.
